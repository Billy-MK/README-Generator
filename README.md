## Description

This project uses the inquirer package to generate professional README.md files for GitHub projects. The user is prompted in the terminal for information typically found in a complete README, and their responses are used to populate a new text file. The README file includes a number of sections, organized by a Table of Contents. This README was generated by the program, and serves as an example of how the final product should look.
